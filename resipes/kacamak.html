<h1>Kačamak</h1>

<img src="../images/kacamak.jpg">
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Being a one-ingredient meal, it’s hard to think of a dish that’s easier on the wallet. 
On top of that, it’s also easy on the stomach, so people often have it as a quick and light breakfast.
And unlike most other Serbian foods, it’s <strong>vegan.</strong></p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>2 cups corn flour</em></li>
<li><em>8 cups water</em></li>
<li><em>salt</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>Instruction</h3>

<ol>
<li>Pour the water into a pot. Add a bit of salt and bring it to a boil.</li> 
<li>Start adding the corn flour bit by bit while stirring the pot and breaking 
    the lumps using a wooden spoon.</li>
<li>Turn the heat down and keep stirring for another five to ten minutes. 
    When you can see the bottom of your pot while stirring, it’s ready!</li>
</ol>

<p>Once it’s done, you can eat kačamak plain or add some milk, cheese, or kajmak for more flavor. Prijatno!</p>
